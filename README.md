# COMP 251 – Data Structures & Algorithms

A collection of Java implementations and exercises completed for **UFV COMP 251 (Data Structures and Algorithms)**.  
Each module focuses on a specific abstract data type or algorithmic concept, implemented in Java 17.

## 🧩 Contents
- **Stack** – Push/pop operations, string reversal, balanced parentheses, infix → postfix conversion.
- **Queue** – FIFO structures, enqueue/dequeue, and circular queue simulation.
- **Linked List** – Node-based design with insert, delete, and concatenation methods.
- **Trees** – Binary tree creation, recursive traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder).
- **Recursion** – Factorial, Fibonacci, and sum-of-odds recursive examples.

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Strengthen understanding of Big-O analysis and algorithmic efficiency.  
- Practice recursion and iterative design.  
- Reinforce OOP concepts using generics in Java.  
- Develop clean, modular, and reusable code.

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Language:** Java 17  
- **IDE:** VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
